# Build a Kafka-Like System From Scratch

This document outlines the steps to create a basic Kafka-like message broker for educational purposes. Each step builds on the previous one to simulate core Kafka features.

---

## **1. Design a Simple Message Broker**
### Overview
Create a broker that can accept and store messages for consumers to retrieve.

### Steps
1. Implement a queue or list to hold messages.
2. Create a `producer` function to push messages into the queue.
3. Create a `consumer` function to pull messages from the queue.

---

## **2. Implement Topics**
### Overview
Organize messages into topics to categorize data streams.

### Steps
1. Use a dictionary/map where each key is a topic name, and the value is a queue.
2. Update the `producer` to specify a topic while sending messages.
3. Update the `consumer` to subscribe to a specific topic.

---

## **3. Add Partitions for Scalability**
### Overview
Divide topics into partitions for parallelism and load distribution.

### Steps
1. Create multiple queues (partitions) for each topic.
2. Use a partitioning strategy (e.g., hash of a key) to decide which partition a message belongs to.
3. Update the `consumer` to subscribe to specific partitions of a topic.

---

## **4. Create a Replication Mechanism**
### Overview
Ensure fault tolerance by replicating partitions across multiple brokers.

### Steps
1. Add multiple brokers, each with their own queues or storage.
2. Copy data from a primary broker (leader) to secondary brokers (replicas).
3. Implement leader election for writing, with replicas available for reads.

---

## **5. Build Offset Management**
### Overview
Allow consumers to track their progress within a partition.

### Steps
1. Assign an incremental offset to each message in a partition.
2. Maintain a mapping of consumer group offsets.
3. Allow consumers to resume from their last processed offset.

---

## **6. Support Consumer Groups**
### Overview
Enable multiple consumers to share the workload of a topic.

### Steps
1. Register consumers into a group.
2. Distribute partitions evenly among consumers in the group.
3. Handle rebalancing when a consumer joins or leaves.

---

## **7. Enable Persistence**
### Overview
Store messages and offsets to disk for durability.

### Steps
1. Write messages to disk during production.
2. Save offsets persistently for recovery.
3. Reload partitions and offsets from disk during startup.

---

## **8. Optimize with Batching**
### Overview
Increase throughput by grouping messages into batches.

### Steps
1. Update the `producer` to send messages in batches.
2. Modify the broker to store and process messages in batches.
3. Update the `consumer` to retrieve batches instead of individual messages.

---

## **9. Add a Metadata API**
### Overview
Provide metadata for clients to discover brokers, topics, and partitions.

### Steps
1. Maintain metadata about topics, partitions, and brokers.
2. Implement an API for clients to query metadata.
3. Return relevant information for producers and consumers.

---

## **10. Build a Communication Protocol**
### Overview
Define how producers, consumers, and brokers interact.

### Steps
1. Create a simple protocol using REST, WebSockets, or raw TCP.
2. Define endpoints or message formats for:
   - Producing messages.
   - Consuming messages.
   - Fetching offsets.
   - Querying metadata.
3. Use serialization (e.g., JSON or Protobuf) for message encoding.

---

## **11. Implement High Availability**
### Overview
Ensure the system can handle broker or partition failures.

### Steps
1. Detect broker or partition failures.
2. Reassign leader roles to replicas during failures.
3. Ensure consumers can failover to alternate brokers seamlessly.

---

## **12. Add Security**
### Overview
Authenticate and authorize clients to prevent unauthorized access.

### Steps
1. Implement authentication (e.g., tokens or user credentials).
2. Implement authorization (e.g., role-based access control for topics).
3. Secure communication channels using TLS or encryption.

---

## **Implementation Notes**
- Start with in-memory data structures, then evolve to disk storage.
- Simulate a single broker at first, then add distributed behavior.
- Optimize for performance after functionality is achieved.

---

## **Tools and Technologies**
- Programming Languages: Python, Node.js, Go, etc.
- Libraries for Networking: `socket`, HTTP frameworks.
- Storage: Filesystem, SQLite, or Redis.
- Serialization: JSON or Protobuf.
